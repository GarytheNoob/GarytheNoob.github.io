## Introduction

Well, this is the repo for my blog(which is running on GitHub Pages, clearly)!

Actually this is my very first complete GitHub repo. I learnt a lot while building it! So I will be very happy if you like this repo â€” and my blog!

If you want to learn more about me, welcome to my [GitHub Profile Page](https://github.com/garythenoob) or the [About Page on my blog](https://garythenoob.github.io/about)!
